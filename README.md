## Dependencies
In order to run the web application, we will need several dependencies installed:

| Dependency  | README |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Python (version 3) | https://www.python.org/ |
| Django  | https://www.djangoproject.com/ |
| airtable.py  | https://github.com/josephbestjames/airtable.py |



There are several ways to install the dependencies. Using a package manager like pip would be reccommended. If you have pip you can run the following command to install Django.
```sh
pip install Django
```
